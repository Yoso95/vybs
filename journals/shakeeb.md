Need to access SpotifyAPI for getting tracks NOT songs. Track Id will be used for adding songs to the user playlist. Finalized API endpoints after discussing with Riley. Going to go through exploration for fastAPI and start coding on Monday!

Feb 9
Worked on our API endpoints and restructured some of our wireframes to work better. Had an to figure out how to add songs to the user playlist.
Went to Riley for help and got it figured. Solution that we got was, once the user makes a playlist and id is assigned to it. The playlist id is then used for adding songs to said playlist.
